/* 4. What are the steps to develop software using the C language? */

Ans - 
Step 1: Download Dev\C++ 
on a Windows operating system.


Step 2: Install Dev/C++ 
When the file is done downloading.
Locate the download file and open the executable file
devcpp-4.9.9.2_setup.exe


Step 3: Create First Project
1. Run Dev/C++
Go to Start Menu > All Programs > Bloodshed Dev-C++ > Dev-C++. This should start the program.

2. Create a New Source File
Create a new source file so you can start writing your first program.
Select File > New > Source File.


Step 4: Write Your Program
Write the first simple program to simply have the computer
say display text to console.

Example -
 /* Write a program to calculate the average of three numbers */

#include<stdio.h>   
#include<conio.h>

int main()
{
    float a;
    printf("Enter the first number ");
    scanf("%f",&a);

    float b;
    printf("Enter the second number ");
    scanf("%f",&b);

    float c;
    printf("Enter the third number ");
    scanf("%f",&c); 

    float avg;
    avg=(a+b+c)/2;
    printf("Average is %f",avg);
    getch();
    return 0;
}

begin learning about what the different functions are doing,read the comments seen in blue font in code
between the /* and the */. This will describle the general idea of what is happening in the code following.


Step 5: Save and Compile Code
1. Save File
Save your file by going to File > Save As.
select save location and name your file

    **IMPORTANT**
Make sure you change the file type to a C
source file (*.c). This is under the save as type.

2.Compile Code
Compile your code by going to Execute > Compile.
This will check through the code to make sure that it is a vaild C file.


Step 6: Run Your Code
1.Run Code
To run your code, select Execute > Run. This will start the program 
and should bring up a new console as seen in the figure below.

2. Follow The Code
Follow and execute what the code is saying.
When it prompts you to enter your name, type
your name and hit Enter using your keybord.

3. Close Program
After the program has finised running.
The console will print out "Press any key to continue..."
To end the program, simply type any key.

Step 7: More Resources
You have now completed your first program.
But don't stop here there is still much to learn about this
great programming language, including arrays, loops, and pointers.
There are many great resources available on the internet and bookstore.
